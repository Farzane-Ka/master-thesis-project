libsvm contains the files in matlabl for training and testing the svm algorithm on our dataset.<br/>
Spid (in the said/src directory) is an open source code based on C++ for extracting IP packets from the network traffic and seperating their header and payload.<br/>
The measurement directory contains the files (written by me) for extracting some features from the packets. These features the time interval between packets, the payload size, measuring the randomness of bits in the payload and so on. <br/>
For my master thesis, I read and understood the entire spid framework to be able to add the additional functionalities to extract my own features.
