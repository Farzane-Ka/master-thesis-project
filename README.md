Spid (in the src directory) is an open source code based on C++ for extracting IP packets from the network traffic and seperating their header and payload.<br/>
The measurement directory contains the files (written by me) for extracting features from the packets. These features are extracting the time interval between packets, payload size, measuring the randomness of bits in the payload and so on. <br\>
For my master thesis, I read and understand the entire spid framework to be able to add the functionality to extract my own features.
